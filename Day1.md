# Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript, DOM, Values & Data Types, and Operators
## introduction :
To sum up, JavaScript stands as a formidable and adaptable programming language, empowering developers to fashion web pages that are both interactive and dynamic.
## DOM :
The Document Object Model (DOM) presents the arrangement of a document in the form of a tree, acting as a means for developers to engage with web pages. In its essence, the DOM provides a straightforward representation of the web page's structure,simple Dom tree :

Example : For instance, by executing "document.title" in the console (using the "inspect" tool), you can retrieve the title of the current page.
## Values & Data Types
JavaScript encompasses a range of values and data types, allowing for diverse expressions. It is essential to differentiate between the data types of "24" (a string) and 24 (a number). The primitive data types in JavaScript consist of strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, bigints, and symbols.
### values : 
Values refer to distinct pieces of information that we manipulate within JavaScript.
 ###### JavaScript introduces two primary categories of data:
- Primitive Types (such as strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null):
These types represent fundamental data units.

-Objects (such as the document and related entities):
Objects encompass more complex data structures
 
## Operators
Operators in JavaScript serve various purposes and can significantly impact values. When working with arithmetic operators, JavaScript respects the order of operations, allowing for the use of parentheses to group expressions effectively.
