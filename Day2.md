# Day2 : 
## Expressions:
Expressions in JavaScript refer to a valid combination of literals, variables, and operators that ultimately result in a single value.

## Arrays
In JavaScript, arrays are fundamental data structures that play a crucial role in storing multiple values within a single variable. Here are the key points covered in this lesson:

Understanding Arrays:

Arrays are collections of items, where each item is stored at a specific index within the array.
The order of items in an array is maintained, allowing for easy retrieval and manipulation.
Accessing Array Items:

Array items can be accessed using their corresponding index. Indexing starts from 0, with the first item at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
The .length property can be used to determine the number of items in an array.
Manipulating Arrays:

JavaScript provides various array methods to manipulate arrays, such as sort, join, and concat.
The sort method rearranges the items in an array in ascending or descending order.
The join method combines all the items of an array into a single string, using a specified separator.
The concat method merges two or more arrays, creating a new array that contains the combined elements.
Mutability of Arrays:

Some array methods modify the original array in-place, altering its contents.
Other array methods create a new array, leaving the original array unchanged.
It is essential to understand which methods mutate the array and which ones return a new array to avoid unintended data mutations.
Immutable Data:

In JavaScript, it is generally recommended to use immutable data and variables whenever possible.
Immutable data means that the data cannot be changed once it is created.
By using immutable data, you can maintain data integrity and avoid unexpected side effects in your code.
Understanding arrays, accessing array items, manipulating arrays with array methods, and embracing the concept of immutable data are all crucial aspects of effectively working with arrays in JavaScript.

## Objects
Objects play a fundamental role in JavaScript, allowing us to represent complex data structures. Here are the key points covered in this lesson:

Understanding Objects:
- Objects in JavaScript store data in key-value pairs, where the key is a string or symbol, and the value can be of any data type.
- Objects provide a way to organize and structure related data together.

Accessing Object Properties:
- Object properties can be accessed using dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object['property']`).
- Dot notation is commonly used when the property name is known and is a valid identifier.
- Bracket notation is useful when the property name is dynamic or contains special characters.

Methods in Objects:
- Objects can have properties that are functions, which we refer to as methods.
- Methods allow objects to perform actions or computations related to the object's data.
- By invoking a method, we can execute the function associated with the method property.

Nested Objects and Arrays:
- JavaScript allows for the nesting of objects and arrays, creating complex and hierarchical data structures.
- This nesting enables the representation of more intricate relationships and data organization.

Built-in Objects:
- JavaScript provides predefined objects like `document`, `console`, `Math`, and `String`, among others.
- These built-in objects come with various methods that perform specific operations or provide useful functionality.

By understanding objects, accessing object properties, working with methods, handling nested objects and arrays, and utilizing built-in objects, you gain the ability to manage and manipulate complex data structures in JavaScript effectively.
